📄 Explanation of why GitHub Pages shows static content  
📄 Links to live application  
📄 Test credentials  
📄 Tech stack overview  

### Why It's Not the Full App
⚠️ GitHub Pages **only hosts static HTML/CSS/JS files**  
⚠️ Cannot run backend servers  
⚠️ Cannot connect to databases  
⚠️ Cannot handle server-side authentication  

This is a **limitation of GitHub Pages**, not your code!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Page is blank"
✅ **Solution:** Make sure you're using the Figma Make URL, not GitHub Pages  
✅ **Correct URL:** https://tcdrkhfd0dr3nv1ps73ge6.figma-make.dev

### "Cannot connect to database"
✅ Check internet connection  
✅ Verify Supabase is not down: https://status.supabase.com  
✅ Clear browser cache and reload

### "Login not working"
✅ Use exact credentials from above (copy/paste)  
✅ Check Caps Lock is off  
✅ Try clearing localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in console

### "Features missing"
✅ Make sure database is seeded (happens automatically on first visit)  
✅ If needed, clear and re-seed: `localStorage.removeItem('db_seeded')` then refresh
